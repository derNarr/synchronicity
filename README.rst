synchronicity : the software
    The folder synchronicity contains the software in order to calculate
    synchronicity and coherence values. More documentation is in that folder.

docs : documentation
    Documentation on the basic ideas for this method with some explenations why
    we choose one implementation over the other.

scripts : scripts
    Scripts for convinince and how I calculated and analysed synchronicity
    values.

animation : scripts for animations
